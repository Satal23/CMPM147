				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Auto Tile generatior for a Dungeon and Island. Features basic animations.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I used techniques such as random number generation and lists to keep track of the grid and its elements. For example I had a list of rectangles to keep track of for the dungeon generation. Each rectangle represented a room that would be build close to the original dungeon.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Though i learned some strategies for autotiling, the project itself was more tedious than anything which made it frustrating. Having to find the coordinate locations of tiles by counting them over and over aswell as the grid in the code and the x/y order being different. Overall I think the project would've been more fun if we were allowed to use any language or program such as unity.</p>
