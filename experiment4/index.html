				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment I created three different infinite worlds based off of a base code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>All three sketches use the same global seed. The location of the camera is also global. The first inifnite world is based off of archipeligos. I tried to recreate the islands with sand and varrying shades of grass aswell as the depth of the water. There is also a function that resembles a day->sunset cycle using milis and adjusting the R values of the colors. The second infinite world is a world based off of the nether biome in minecraft. The Lava/orange blocks in this world glow over time using Milis and adjusting their red value. For the final inifnite world I tried to recreate the sand biome in Minecraft. The sand biome features sand gravel and lava. It also features a day night cycle.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I enjoyed recreating worlds for minecraft specifically since minecraft is a voxel game, the look I achieved looked very similar to minecrafts biomes. </p>
